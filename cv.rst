Professional experience
-----------------------

.. class:: resume-headline

**R&D developer - SensioLabs**, *05/2011 - Present, Paris, France*

`SensioLabs`_ is an open source specialist and creator of the PHP framework
`Symfony`_. SensioLabs offers a wide range of services around Symfony 1 & 2.
(80+ employees, 11M€ revenue)

I am in charge of developing and maintaining `SensioLabs Connect`_ and other
products which are in the process of being launched.

I'm under the direct responsibility and in close collaboration with Fabien
Potencier, CEO of SensioLabs and lead developer of the Symfony framework and
components.

My daily work routine is discussing new features with him, designing,
implementing and finally deploying them.

Disclosed project:

- SensioLabs Connect is the first step of a developer social network and
  reputation engine. We track developer activity and reward them with badges
  when they reach an achievement. It's also the main authentication point for
  all SensioLabs products. It features an OAuth2 provider and an hypermedia
  API.

- I also maintain parts of the Symfony official website and some other
  related websites within the SensioLabs galaxy.

I am also an occasional Symfony trainer and I regularly provide technical
advice to the development team.

**Developer - SensioLabs**, *from November 2009 to May 2011, Paris, France*

I first started as a developer for projects such as SensioLabs Trainings,
the intranet for Les Editions Eyrolles, L'Express and Ma Residence.

After that, I was the lead developer on a set of projects for L'Express.
I was also in charge of the set-up and maintenance of internal tools. I
made the switch from SensioLabs in-house continuous integration system to
Jenkins, in which it was possible to run Selenium test suites in a Firefox
browser running in a headless X11 server, and see the progress, thanks to VNC.

Projects:

- `L'Express Culture`_

  L'Express is one of the 3 most visited French news websites.  This
  application is a cultural encyclopedia where all content is written by
  their journalists.  This project was built using some Symfony2 components and
  symfony1 and boasts a multi-tier architecture. It extensively uses ESI and
  HttpCache.

- `L'Express Communauté`_

  This application is a social network for both journalists and readers of
  L'Express news site. The social network features "follow" and "activity feed"
  functions. The topbar is displayed on all pages of l'express.fr website
  and receives a lot of hits per day. This application was written using
  symfony1.

- `La plateforme du bâtiment`_

  "La plateforme du bâtiment" (The construction platform) is an e-commerce
  shop for construction workers. I worked on the website's search engine
  using Solr. It searches products available in different stores and features
  faceting and autocomplete.

**Developer - Une vie moins chere**, *from July 2009 to November 2009, Paris, France*

"Une vie moins chere" was a website that gave you tips for saving on your daily
expenses. I was in charge of starting the design and the implementation of a
price comparison service and a CMS before the lead developer joined the
company.

**Freelance developer**, *from 2001 to 2009, Lyon, France*

I was hired by various small-sized companies and NPOs to create or improve
their online presence. Websites created ranged from one-page websites to a full
community-centered application which featured a blog, a forum and an event
calendar.
