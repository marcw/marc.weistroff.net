Marc Weistroff, PHP5 & Symfony Developer
========================================

Paris, France. Relocating to Toronto, Canada on september 2012.

Self made, passionate, dynamic, experimented and pragmatic PHP5
developer. Curious and fast learner, I want to work in a highly technical and
challenging environment. My daily tools are Vim, Git, Symfony2, Doctrine2, Bash,
PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, PHPUnit, Jenkin, OSX and Linux.

Professionel experiences
------------------------

**R&D developer - SensioLabs**, *05/2011 - Present, Paris, France*

I am in charge of developing and maintaining SensioLabs Connect and other products which are in the process of being launched.

I'm under the direct responsability and in close collaboration with Fabien Potencier, CEO of SensioLabs and creator of the Symfony framework and components.

My daily work routine is discussing new features with him, designing, implementing and finally deploying them.

Disclosed project:

- SensioLabs Connect is the first step of a developer social network and
  reputation engine. We track developer activity and reward them with badges
  when they reach an achievement. It's also the main authentication point for
  all SensioLabs products. It features an OAuth2 provider and an hypermedia
  API.

I am also an occasional Symfony trainer and I provide regular technical advice to the development team.

keywords: php, symfony-2.0, nginx, apache2, postgres, mysql, rabbitmq, fabric, bash, git, github, varnish, assetic.

**Developer - SensioLabs**, *from november 2009 to may 2011, Paris, France*

I first started to be a developer for projects such as SensioLabs Trainings,
the intranet for Les Editions Eyrolles, L'Express and Ma Residence.

After that, I have been the lead developer on a set of projects for L'Express.
I have also been in charge of the set-up and maintenance of internal tools. I
have made the switch from SensioLabs in-house continuous integration system to
Jenkins, in which it was possible to run Selenium test suites in a Firefox
browser running in a headless X11 server, and see the progress, thanks to VNC.

Projects:

- L'Express Culture - http://fiches.lexpress.fr

  L'Express is one of the 3 most visited French news websites.  This
  application is a cultural encyclopedia where all contents are written by
  their journalists.  This project was built using some Symfony2 components and
  symfony1 and boasts a multi-tier architecture. It extensively uses ESI and
  HttpCache.

- L'Express communauté - http://communaute.lexpress.fr

  This application is a social network for both journalists and readers of
  L'Express news site. The social network features "follow" and "activity feed"
  functionalities. The topbar is displayed on all pages of l'express.fr website
  and receives a lot of hits per day. This application was written using
  symfony1.

- La plateforme du batiment - http://www.laplateforme.com

  I worked on the search engine of the website using Solr. It searches products
  in different stores and features faceting and autocomplete.

keywords: php, symfony, symfony-2.0, apache2, mysql, svn, solr, git.

**Developer - Une vie moins chere**, *from july 2009 to november 2009, Paris, France*

I was in charge of designing and implementing a price comparison service and a CMS.

**Freelance developer**, *from 2001 to 2009, Lyon, France*

I have been hired by various small sized companies and NPO to create or improve their online presence.

**Bartender - Café 203**, *from 2004 to 2008, Lyon, France*

Benevolent activities
---------------------

I had been strongly involved in the local electronic music scene from 2004 to
2008. I was member of the executive committee of several NPOs. I organized
events in venues able to host from 50 to 1000 persons. Therefore I was
fully involved in the management of events organization and learned
from planning the event, communicate on it, managing volunteer teams,
concretising the event.
