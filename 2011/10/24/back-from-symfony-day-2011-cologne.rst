  The one where I talk about the Symfony Day conference in Cologne.

Back from SfDay 2011 Cologne
============================

I'm now back to my daily work at SensioLabs after some days spent at Cologne,
mostly for the Symfony Day 2011. It was truly great to be there. I had the
chance to put faces on twitter nicknames and to talk in front of the crowd. I
was a bit nervous and wasn't as relaxed as I would liked to be. I will try to
work on my english pronunciation for the next times.

Many thanks to the SensioLabs Deutschland & Interlution team, it was really a
nice moment.

Oh, and here are the slides of my talk.
