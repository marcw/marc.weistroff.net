Kids. Backuping your data is great. But assure you that your backups also
contain your database. I've lost all the posts of this blogs and much more.
Nothing to say that I was really pissed off.

I wanted to recreate this blog from scratch but got distract by other things.
After a few months of procrastinating and slapping myself for not having a
place to write, I found a great theme based on twitter bootstrap for wordpress
and decided to give it a go. I'm pretty happy with that.

Let's hope I'll have the strength to write some interesting articles.

Oh, I'm currently concerned by twitter/facebook tracking on the web and won't
add "tweet this" or "like" button but I will, for now, conserve the Google
analytics tracking script and the feedburner thingy.

P.S : The picture and the post's title come from the awesome `Clerks
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109445/>`_ and `Clerks 2
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424345/>`_ movies. If you haven't seen them, it's
never too late.
