Last year, I started what I would like to become a personal tradition. I
decided to create a playlist that would describe my prominent emotions of the
year that just passed. The creative process would be a way for me to look back
at the year, both emotionaly and musically. I was afraid though that it would
be an endless process and that I would end up putting up an endless collection
of tracks without any meaning. I needed some limitations.

I always liked the length limitation of vinyls. Back in the days, album were
also designed with that limit in mind and you could really feel how it
influenced the construction of the album. The original [LP
record](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_record) had a maximum playing time of
nearly 45 minutes, or 22 minutes by side. I decided to take this restriction
and to add another one: Only 4 tracks by side.

These constaints gave me a framework which enabled me to focus myself on the
most important phases I went through during the year. I added a soft constraint
as well: Tracks should be the one I listened to during this year.

Without further ado, here is my 2014 retrospective.
