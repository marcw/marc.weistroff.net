Well the year isn't over yet but I wanted to write down what inspired me in the
past 12 months. Like you, I’m always looking around for interesting work to
nourish my mind. Sign of times, I haven’t read many books. It’s been mostly an
audio/video year. I watched a hell lot of TV though. Netflix doesn’t help in
that matter... I’ve had a huge interest in comedy. I discovered the american
alt-comedy scene and have been struck by their creativity and blunt thoughts.

## Stand-Up specials

- [Reggie Watts](http://www.reggiewatts.com/) - [Why Shit So
  Crazy](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/reggie_watts_why_shit_so_crazy/)

## TV Shows

Once again, comedy was a central theme in my choices. I stopped watching other
shows that I won't name here.

- [Peep Show](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387764/)
- [Louie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1492966/) 
- [Maron](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2520512/) 
- [Freaks and Geeks](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0193676/)
- [Mad Men](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men)

## Movies

I watched other great movies than those present in this list, but I prefer to
keep it short.

- [La Grande Bellezza](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2358891/)
- [Jodorowsky's Dune](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1935156/)

## Music

This year was really interesting on the music side. I started buying vinyls
again and went back to my turntables. I discovered really good house and techno
tracks, but in the end I prefer to list these indie bands.

- [The Acid](http://wearetheacid.com/)
- [Django Django](http://www.djangodjango.co.uk/)
- [Parquet Courts](http://parquetcourts.wordpress.com/)
- [Nothing](https://wearenothing.bandcamp.com)

## Club Night

[Laurent Garnier](http://www.laurentgarnier.com/) at [Stereo Night
Club](http://www.stereonightclub.net/) in Montreal. This club has the best
sound system. Period. Forget the clinical coldness of a [Funktion
One](http://www.funktion-one.com/) system. This one has a warm and beautiful
sound. Laurent Garnier did a good set, sticking perfectly to the club’s
atmosphere.

## Books

I haven't read much. Or not as much as I'd like. Or maybe too much. My whole
days are spent reading stuff. Be it code, articles, emails, social medias. At
the end of the day, I much prefer watching and listening than reading

- [Blankets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blankets_%28comics%29) by Craig
  Thompson

## Exhibitions

- [The Enclave](http://portlandartmuseum.org/exhibitions/enclave/) by
  photographer [Richard Mosse](http://www.richardmosse.com/) at  FOAM.
- [Marcel Wenders: Pinned
  Up](http://www.stedelijk.nl/en/exhibitions/marcel-wanders-pinned-up-at-the-stedelijk)
  at Stedelijk Museum.

Does this post need a conclusion? Naaah. You'll do fine without.
