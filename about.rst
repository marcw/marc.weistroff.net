About this Website
------------------

This website is hosted on Amazon S3.

The website itself is written in restructured text and built with a small
script. Sourcecode can be `found on github
<http://github.com/marcw/marc.weistroff.net>`_.

I'd like to thanks `Armin Ronacher <http://lucumr.pocoo.org/>`_ for his wonderful tool to build static blogs.
