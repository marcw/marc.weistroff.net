Why I Stopped self-hosting my mails, IM and website
===================================================

A year ago, I started an experiment. I wanted to quit gmail and gtalk
services and prove to me that I could host my emails and my IM
myself. It went quite well but I decided to stop and
subscribed to `fastmail.fm <http://fastmail.fm>`_ and to
`hosted.im <http://hosted.im>`_.

Installation
------------

A year ago, I spent some days installing a fully functionnal mail/web/jabber
server.  Hopefully, I had some `good tutorials
<http://flurdy.com/docs/postfix/>`_ about setting up a mail server. On the
jabber side, it was quite easy even if sometime, my WTF-o-meter level was
really high. I blame my totally absent knowledge of erlang and mnesia here.

The easiest part was to set-up the varnish, nginx part of the server. This is
because I use these technologies every day. I still think that serving static
files with a reverse proxy could be much more easier and quicker to setup.

Backuping is easy and cheap, thanks to Amazon S3. I did not suffer any crash
and did not have to restore my data. I think I would have cried if I had to do
that because of the time needed to set-up the server again. The pain would have
been bearable thanks to the EBS (if it doesn't fail).

My final set-up used these technologies: Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon
CloudFront, Amazon Elastic Block Storage, Postfix, Dovecot, Sieve, Varnish,
Postgrey, Spamassassin, Nginx and Ejabberd.

Running it
----------

Here is what I learned:

- SMTP servers obey Murphy's Law. If you have an important mail to send, it
  will fail. Fallbacking to gmail happened to many time.

- ejabberd is stable. In a year of operation, it failed once and
  restarting it made did the trick. The `guys behind ejabberd <http://www.process-one.net/en/>`_ did a really great job.

- Spam was virtually absent from my mail. Spamassasin and postgrey worked well.

- `Sieve <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_%28mail_filtering_language%29>`_ is
  great. I mean really really GREAT. Filtering mail in gmail is a pain.

- Mail clients all suck. Sparrow was an exception.

- I'm not nerdy enough to use `Mutt <http://www.mutt.org/>`_.

- I should have used a configuration management system like Chef, Puppet or
  CFEngine to create the server. It would have doubled/tripled the time
  required to configure it properly, but it would have been an asset if I
  wanted to migrate my services to another host, which I considered at some
  point.

Now
---

Yesterday, and after too many problem with my SMTP server, I decided to end
this experiment and started looking for a reliable mail provider. I chose
fastmail.fm because of the price, migrations processes and the Sieve support.

This website is now hosted by Amazon S3.
The only cron job that I had is now run on heroku.
My jabber service is being migrated to hosted.im.

This will costs me around 50$ a year and this is definitely worth the time I
won't put in managing my old instance.

Creating, installing and configuring software is easy. Achieving reliability is
hard.
