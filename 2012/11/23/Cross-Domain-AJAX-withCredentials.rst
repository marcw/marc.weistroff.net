Authenticated Cross-Domains AJAX Requests with CORS
===================================================

Yesterday, I lost a significant amount of time dealing with cross-domain AJAX
requests and I thought I might share a bit of what I learned.

1. jQuery 1.5.0 is BROKEN when it comes to cross-domain AJAX requests. Upgrade
   to at least jQuery 1.5.1.

2. ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin`` WON'T accept a wildcard value if your XHR's
   ``withCredentials`` option is set to ``true``. Also, it won't accept a list
   of origin. If you want to accept requests from a lot of domains, you can
   match the ``Origin`` request header against a set of domains and set the
   ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin`` accordingly.

3. ``Access-Control-Allow-Headers`` and ``Access-Control-Allow-Methods`` CORS
   header does not support `*` as a value. You have to be specific, even during
   your prototyping phase.

Hope it helps.
